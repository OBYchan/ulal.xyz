              A frontend engineer, now work in Tokopedia as Principal Engineer Web Platform.
              I already start my software engineering careers since 2013.
              Before joining Tokopedia, I work on several companies such as Bizzy Indonesia, Blibli.com and SML Technologies.

              I used to build the web using various JavaScript framework, or I can say that I am not fanatic with any frameworks out there.
              I have professional experience with the at least some of popular JavaScript frameworks like React.js, Svelte, Vue.js, AngularJS in the early version.
              I always prefer writing unit test rather than test my code manually.
              I have experience in writing many custom configuration for the build tools for the front end codebase. 
              You just name it, webpack, rollup, or even the Node.js custom script, I can work with it (<i>or at least I can learn it easily if I don't know it yet</i>).

              Outside my daily job as a full time employee, I also build a close connection with many programmer communities in Indonesia to giving back my limited knowledge and experience in the web development topic to the community.
